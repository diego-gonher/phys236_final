## [[Power Spectrum and Correlation Function]]

- How is the correlation function Î¾(r) defined?
- How is the power spectrum P(k) defined?
- What do they mean qualitatively and what is the relationship between them?

## [[Gaussian and Non-Gaussian random fields]]

- What is a Gaussian random field? How would this differ from a non-Gaussian random field? 
- Provide a cosmological example from the course of a Gaussian random field and a non-Gaussian random field.
