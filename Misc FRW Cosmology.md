### How does the energy density of cold dark matter scale with redshift? How does the energy density in radiation scale with redshift? 

### How does the temperature of the CMB scale with redshift? 

### What is the relation between scale factor a(t) and redshift z? 

### Suppose a certain radioactive decay produces an emission line at 1000 A, with a characteristic decay time of 5 days. If we observe this line from a galaxy at z = 3, at what wavelength do we detect this line, and whatâ€™s the decay timescale? 

### People talk a lot about the search for w in dark energy - how is w defined?
