### How does the energy density of cold dark matter scale with redshift? How does the energy density in radiation scale with redshift? 
We treat cold dark matter as being a part of the matter component in the universe's energy budget, where we say $w=0$. Thus, its energy density scales like:

$$
\rho_{DM} \propto a^{-3} \propto (1+z)^{3}
$$

For radiation, as we saw previously, $w=1/3$, and consequently:

$$
\rho_{rad} \propto a^{-4} \propto (1+z)^{4}
$$

### How does the temperature of the CMB scale with redshift? 
Given that the CMB is part of the radiation component of the energy budget, we have that $\rho_{CMB} \propto T_{CMB}^4$. Consequently:

$$
T^4_{CMB} \propto a^{-4} \propto (1+z)^{4}
$$

$$
\implies T_{CMB} \propto (1+z)
$$

### What is the relation between scale factor a(t) and redshift z? 
The scale factor $a$ and redshift $z$ are related in the following manner:

$$
a = \frac{1}{1+z}
$$

### Suppose a certain radioactive decay produces an emission line at 1000 A, with a characteristic decay time of 5 days. If we observe this line from a galaxy at z = 3, at what wavelength do we detect this line, and whatâ€™s the decay timescale? 

### People talk a lot about the search for w in dark energy - how is w defined?
