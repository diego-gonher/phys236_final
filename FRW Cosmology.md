# FRW Cosmology

## [[FRW Metric]]

- Ignoring angular terms, write down the FRW metric. 
- Hence express the line-of-sight comoving distance $d_c$ as an function of a) time, b) redshift. 
- Provide definitions for i) angular diameter distance, ii) luminosity distance (you donâ€™t have to derive them, just explain what they are), and explain why they are sensitive to cosmological parameters. 
- How are they related to the comoving distance in a flat universe?

## [[Friedmann Equations]]

- Write down the Friedmann equation and the fluid equation in a flat universe (i.e. ignore curvature terms).
- Show that in a vacuum-dominated universe with $\rho_\Lambda \approx$  const, the scale factor increases exponentially with time.
- Find the relation between scale factor and time in a matter dominated and a radiation dominated universe.
- How is the Hubble parameter related to the scale factor a(t)?
- Write down the approximate value of the Hubble constant today (including correct units), and hence give a rough estimate of the age of the universe.
