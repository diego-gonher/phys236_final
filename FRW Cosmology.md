# FRW Cosmology

## [[FRW Metric]]

- Ignoring angular terms, write down the FRW metric. 
- Hence express the line-of-sight comoving distance $d_c$ as an function of a) time, b) redshift. 
- Provide definitions for i) angular diameter distance, ii) luminosity distance (you don’t have to derive them, just explain what they are), and explain why they are sensitive to cosmological parameters. 
- How are they related to the comoving distance in a flat universe?

## [[Friedmann Equations]]

- Write down the Friedmann equation and the fluid equation in a flat universe (i.e. ignore curvature terms).
- Show that in a vacuum-dominated universe with $\rho_\Lambda \approx$  const, the scale factor increases exponentially with time.
- Find the relation between scale factor and time in a matter dominated and a radiation dominated universe.
- How is the Hubble parameter related to the scale factor a(t)?
- Write down the approximate value of the Hubble constant today (including correct units), and hence give a rough estimate of the age of the universe.

## [[Critical Density]]

- Derive the critical density $\rho_{crit}$ in terms of the Hubble constant $H_0$. 
- Given the present value of the Hubble constant, express ρcrit in physical units ($gcm^{−3}$). 
- If I tell you that $\Omega_b = 0.04$ and that the universe is pure hydrogen, what is the number density of protons today?

## [[Misc FRW Cosmology]]
- How does the energy density of cold dark matter scale with redshift? How does the energy density in radiation scale with redshift? 
- How does the temperature of the CMB scale with redshift? 
- What is the relation between scale factor a(t) and redshift z? 
- Suppose a certain radioactive decay produces an emission line at 1000 A, with a characteristic decay time of 5 days. If we observe this line from a galaxy at z = 3, at what wavelength do we detect this line, and what’s the decay timescale? 
- People talk a lot about the search for w in dark energy—how is w defined?
