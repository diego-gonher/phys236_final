# FRW Cosmology

## [[FRW Metric]]

- Ignoring angular terms, write down the FRW metric. 
- Hence express the line-of-sight comoving distance $d_c$ as an function of a) time, b) redshift. 
- Provide definitions for i) angular diameter distance, ii) luminosity distance (you donâ€™t have to derive them, just explain what they are), and explain why they are sensitive to cosmological parameters. 
- How are they related to the comoving distance in a flat universe?
