# Thermal History

## [[Modern Estimates from Thermal History]]

- What are modern estimates for the CMB temperature Tγ today?
- What are modern estimates for Ωm, ΩΛ, h.
- Estimate the redshift zeq of matter radiation equality, derive it, don’t just state it. You can ignore the contribution from neutrinos in this estimate. How would including neutrinos modify this calculation?

## [[Boltzmann Supression]]

- Explain the the physics behind the idea of “Boltzmann-suppression”

## [[Neutrino Temperature]]

- Explain why the neutrino temperature is different from the CMB temperature. Is it higher or lower? Extra credit if you can estimate its numerical value.

## [[Effective Degrees of Freedom]]

- How is the effective number of degrees of freedom g(T) defined? 
- How is the effective number of degrees of freedom in entropy gS(T) defined? 
- Why are these definitions useful? How are these two quantities different? 
- When in the universe’s thermal history does g(T) = gS(T)? When does g(T) != gS(T)?
