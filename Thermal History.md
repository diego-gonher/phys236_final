# Thermal History

## [[Modern Estimates from Thermal History]]

- What are modern estimates for the CMB temperature Tγ today?
- What are modern estimates for Ωm, ΩΛ, h.
- Estimate the redshift zeq of matter radiation equality, derive it, don’t just state it. You can ignore the contribution from neutrinos in this estimate. How would including neutrinos modify this calculation?

## [[Boltzmann Supression]]

- Explain the the physics behind the idea of “Boltzmann-suppression”
