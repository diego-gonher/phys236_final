# Linear Structure Formation

## [[Jeans Scale]]

- Describe the physical significance of the Jeans scale λJ .

## [[Reconciliation of the CMB anisotropies]]

- Explain why dark matter is required to reconcile the level of anisotropy in the CMB temperature ∆T/T ∼ 10−5 with the highly non-linear structures that are observed today, or specifically that σ(R = 8 h−1 Mpc) ≃ 1.
