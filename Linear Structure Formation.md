# Linear Structure Formation

## [[Jeans Scale]]

- Describe the physical significance of the Jeans scale λJ .

## [[Reconciliation of the CMB anisotropies]]

- Explain why dark matter is required to reconcile the level of anisotropy in the CMB temperature ∆T/T ∼ 10−5 with the highly non-linear structures that are observed today, or specifically that σ(R = 8 h−1 Mpc) ≃ 1.

## [[Meszaros effect]]

- What is the Meszaros effect?

## [[Growth factor D of density fluctuations]]

- How does the growth factor D of density fluctuations depend on the scale factor a(t) in the following 4 cases: superhorizon and (i) matter-dominated (ii) radiation dominated; sub-horizon and (iii) matter-dominated (iv) radiation-dominated (assume a flat universe). 
- For sub-horizon perturbations, provide a brief physical argument for why the radiation-dominated case is either faster or slower than the matter-dominated case.

## [[Perturbed Poisson Equation]]

- Write down the perturbed Poisson equation.
- Show that in a flat matter dominated universe, linear potential fluctuations are time-independent.

## [[The Density Perturbation Power Spectrum]]

- Sketch the density perturbation power spectrum P(k) vs. k, and explain the reason for the asymptotic slopes at the low-k and high-k ends.  
- What characteristic length scale does the peak in the power spectrum P(k) correspond to?

## [[Free Streaming]]

- What is free-streaming? 
- How does one calculate the free-streaming length? 
- Describe how free-streaming modifies the shape of the linear power spectrum for hot or warm dark matter.

## [[CDM and Hierarchical Cosmology]]

- For a power law form for the density fluctuation power spectrum, P(k) = Ak^n, how does the variance of the relative mass excess σ(M) depend on length scale k? 
- How do σ(M) and P(k) depend on the linear growth factor D(a)? 
- Explain why these dependencies imply that the CDM is a ‘bottom-up’ hierarchical cosmology, with the smallest structures collapsing first.
