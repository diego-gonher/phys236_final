# Linear Structure Formation

## [[Jeans Scale]]

- Describe the physical significance of the Jeans scale λJ .

## [[Reconciliation of the CMB anisotropies]]

- Explain why dark matter is required to reconcile the level of anisotropy in the CMB temperature ∆T/T ∼ 10−5 with the highly non-linear structures that are observed today, or specifically that σ(R = 8 h−1 Mpc) ≃ 1.

## [[Meszaros effect]]

- What is the Meszaros effect?

## [[Growth factor D of density fluctuations]]

- How does the growth factor D of density fluctuations depend on the scale factor a(t) in the following 4 cases: superhorizon and (i) matter-dominated (ii) radiation dominated; sub-horizon and (iii) matter-dominated (iv) radiation-dominated (assume a flat universe). 
- For sub-horizon perturbations, provide a brief physical argument for why the radiation-dominated case is either faster or slower than the matter-dominated case.

## [[Perturbed Poisson Equation]]

- Write down the perturbed Poisson equation.
- Show that in a flat matter dominated universe, linear potential fluctuations are time-independent.
