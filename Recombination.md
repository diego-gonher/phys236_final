# Recombination

## [[Recombination and Photon Decoupling]]

- Briefly explain the baryon to photon ratio.
- At what redshift did recombination take place? What was the temperature of the universe then, and how did the characteristic energy kT compare with the ionization potential of hydrogen, BH = 13.6eV. 
- Why is the characteristic energy kT significantly lower than BH? 
- What is the difference between recombination and photon decoupling?
