# Critical Density

### Derive the critical density ρ_crit in terms of the Hubble constant H_0. 
For a flat universe, the Friedmann Equation is:

$$
H^2 = \frac{8 \pi G \rho}{3}
$$

We can define the density that satisifies this as the critical density. For the current time, that leaves us with:

$$
\rho_{crit,0} = \frac{3c^2 H_0^2}{8 \pi G}
$$

### Given the present value of the Hubble constant, express ρcrit in physical units (g cm^−3). 
Using $H_0 = 70$ $km$ $s^{-1}$ $Mpc^{-1}$, we can get a current estimate for the critical density:

$$
\rho_{crit,0} \approx 9.2 \times 10^{-30} \hspace{0.15cm} g \hspace{0.15cm} cm^{-3} 
$$

### If I tell you that Ωb = 0.04 and that the universe is pure hydrogen, what is the number density of protons today?
For a specific energy component, we can define the density parameter $\Omega_c$ as follows:

$$
\Omega_c = \frac{\rho_c}{\rho_{crit}}
$$
Assuming all baryions are pure Hydrogen, we can estimate the number density of protons by doing the following:

$$
n_{p,0} = \frac{\Omega_{b,0} \rho_{crit,0}}{m_p} \approx 2.2\times10^{-7} \hspace{0.15cm} cm^{-3}
$$
