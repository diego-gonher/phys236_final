# Growth factor D of density fluctuations

## How does the growth factor D of density fluctuations depend on the scale factor a(t) in the following 4 cases: superhorizon and (i) matter-dominated (ii) radiation dominated; sub-horizon and (iii) matter-dominated (iv) radiation-dominated (assume a flat universe). 

## For sub-horizon perturbations, provide a brief physical argument for why the radiation-dominated case is either faster or slower than the matter-dominated case.
